Ruxed - Ruby XML editor is not just another XML editor.
This editor serves several needs: 
- editing XML
- programming an XML transformation in Ruby
- on-the-fly viewing of the result in IE
The transformation part was inspired by Martin Fowler's article on Rake

To run the examples after uninstalling the ruxed gem:
1: >cd lib
2: >ruby ../bin/ruxed ../samples/xdoc.xml  ../samples/xdoc.rb
